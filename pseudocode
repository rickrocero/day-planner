// DAY PLANNER HOMEWORK
// Setup HTML
  //get moment and bootstrap cdn links (for bootstrap:  css and JS cdn link from the docs)
  //layout the html
    //add a jumbotron that display current day and date using moment (e.g. Wed, Mar 31st)
  //create rows for hours (9am-5pm)
    //parent div / hour div / text input /save button

//Start JavaScript
  //setup a click event on the save buttons
    // using the event.target, traverse the dom from the button to the textarea
    // also grab a unique identifier for placing the hour input value into localStorage

  // on pageload, pull all data from local storage and use the unique labels/identifiers mentioned above to determine where to put the value retrieved from localStorage

  // for determining css backgroundcolor:
    // then iterate over all hour elements
    //use moment to get the current time (specifically the hour)
    // using an id/data attribute, determining what hour the current timeblock respresents (i.e the 'moment time')
      // if the current element time is: 
        // less than moment time, its grey
        // same as moment time, its red
        // greater than moment time, its green
